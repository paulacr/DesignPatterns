***Abstract Factory Pattern***

*Definition*

- It's like a factory but everything is encapsulated (method that orders object,
factory that build objects, the final objects contains objects that use the
strategy pattern)

- It allows us to create families of related objects without specifying the concrete class
- Used when many objects can be added or removed at runtime
- The objects will interact through common interfaces
